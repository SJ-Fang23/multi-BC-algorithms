# Mutiple baseline BC algorithms
This library provides multiple behavioral cloning algorithms that are intended to serve as baselines for our ongoing project about imitation learning with a world model. The implemented algorithms include vanilla BC, IBC [[Link](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v164/florence22a/florence22a.pdf)], and Diffusion Policy [[Link](https://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss19/p026.pdf)].
